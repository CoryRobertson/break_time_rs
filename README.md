# break_time_rs

break_time_rs is an application that intends to enforce small breaks between work sessions when working on a computer.
By default, the program overlays an image on screen, that prevents work from getting done, for a user set (default 5 minutes for ever 55 minutes) amount of time.
The user can press / + \ on their keyboard at the same time to open the options overlay. 
Additionally, if there is a png file next to the executable named overlay.exe, the program will instead use that as an overlay.
As of now, the program has only been tested on windows 10, but it should work on other versions of windows, as well as gtk based linux desktops.
